# ü©∫ Diabetes Prediction with SVM

This project demonstrates the development of a **machine learning-based model** using **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** to predict the likelihood of a person having **diabetes** based on various medical attributes such as **age**, **BMI (Body Mass Index)**, **blood pressure**, **insulin levels**, and more.

## ‚ú® Features

‚úÖ Predict the likelihood of diabetes based on medical attributes  
‚úÖ Uses **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**, a powerful classification algorithm  
‚úÖ Takes into account the following features:
- Age
- BMI (Body Mass Index)
- Blood Pressure
- Insulin Level
- Glucose Level (if included in dataset)
- And other relevant medical data

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

| Technology | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **Python** | Core programming language for model development |
| **Scikit-learn** | Machine learning library for SVM and model evaluation |
| **Pandas** | Data manipulation and preprocessing |
| **NumPy** | Numerical computations |
| **Matplotlib** / **Seaborn** | Data visualization and evaluation metrics |

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Data Collection**: The model takes in medical attributes like age, BMI, blood pressure, and insulin levels.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data (e.g., handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables).
3. **Model Training**: The **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** is trained on the dataset to classify whether a person is likely to have diabetes or not.
4. **Prediction**: Once trained, the model predicts the likelihood of diabetes based on new input data.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Performance is assessed using metrics like **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score**.
